    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>
      The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options,and you
      must choose one of these.After you make your choice you will get a new set
      of options;just what set of options you get depends on what you made.This
      procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state.If you
      made a good sequence of choices,your final state is a goal state;if you
      didn't, it isn't
    </p>

    <p>
      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree;the tree probaably has some
      good leaves,though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad..you
      want to get to a good leaf.At each node,beginning with the root,you choose
      one of its children to move to,and you keep this up until you get to a
      leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you get to a bad leaf.You can backtrack to continue the search for
      a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next
      option in that set of options.If you run out of options, revoke the choice
      that got you here,and try another choice at that node. If you end up at
      the root with no options left, that there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>This needs an example</p>
    <img src="./Image_root.png" height="150" width="250" />
    <ol>
      <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B.you choose A.</li>
      <li>At A,your options are C and D. you choose C.</li>
      <li>C is bad. Go back to A</li>
      <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed.Try D.</li>
      <li>D is bad.Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A,you have no options left to try. Try B.</li>
      <li>At Root you have already tried A.Try E</li>
      <li>At B,your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
      <li>E is good.Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In this example we drew a picture of a tree.The tree is an abstract model
      of the possible sequences of choices we could make.There is also a data
      structure called a tree,but usually we don't have a data structure to tell
      us what choices we have.(If we do have an actual tree data
      structure,backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)
    </p>
    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <pre>
boolean solve{Node n} {
           if n is a leaf node{
               if the leaf is a goal node, return true
               else return false
           } else {
             for each child c of n{
                 if solve(c) succeeds,return true
             }
            return false
            }
          }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function.This is
      essential to understanding the algorithm.If solve(n) is true,that means
      node n is part of a solution--that is,node n is one of the nodes on a path
      from the root to some goal node.we say that n is solvable.If solve(n) is
      false,then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p>
    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>if any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
      <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Hence,to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable {part of path to a
      goal node}, all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable.
      This is done recursively,on each childof n. In the above code,this is done
      by the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
  for each child c of n{
             if solve(c) succeeds,return true
            }
            return false
    </pre>
    <p>
      Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. if the leaf
      node is a goal node, it is solvable,if the leaf node is not a goal node,R
      is not solvable.This is our base case. In the above code, This is done by
      the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
 
          if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
          }
    </pre>
    <p>
      The backtracking algorithm is simple but important.You should understand
      it throughly. Another way of starting it is as follows.
    </p>
    <h2>.To search a tree:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the tree consists of a single leaf,test wheather it is a goal node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
        node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
    <p>
      Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
      algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. in fact,that is how your
      recursive algorithm are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>
    <pre>
      boolean solve {Node n}{
        put node n on the stack;
        while the stack is not empty{
          if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
            if it is a goal node, return true 
            else pop it off the stack
          }
          else{
           if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
               push the next untried child onto the stack
              else pop the node off the stack

          }
          return false
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Starting from the root, the only nodesthat can be pushed onto the stack
      are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these
      are only pushed on one child at a time;hence, the nodes on the stack at
      all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the
      stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their
      descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack
      empty),there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stack algorithm terminates successfully the nodes on the stack
      form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.
    </p>
    <pre>
 
      boolean solve(Node n) {
        if n is a leaf node{
          if the leaf is  goal node{
            print n
            return true 
          }
           else return false
          }else {
            for each child c of n {
              if solve(c) succeeds{
                print n
                return true
              }
            }
            return false
          }
        }
    </pre>
    <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
    <p>
      All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but
      when applied to a real problem, they can pretty cluttered up with
      details.Even determining wheather the node is a leaf can be complex:
    </p>
    <p>
      for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
      problem, the leaves are checkmate and stalemate solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep the program clean, therefore,tests like this should be buried in
      methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test wheather a node is a
      leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it
      <b>isLeaf).</b>This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of
      figuring out wheather any possible moves remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each
      node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already
      {so we don't have to try them again}.In the above code we made this look
      simple by just saying <b>for each child c of n.</b> In reality, it may be
      difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be
      no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can be
      represented one arrangement of pieces on chessboard, and each child of
      that node can represent the arrangement after some pieces has made a legal
      move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which
      ones you've already examined?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
      been tried is as follows.Upon initial entry to the node {that is, when you
      first get there from above}, make a list of all its children.As you try
      each child , take it off the list. when the list is empty, there are no
      remaining untried children, and you can return "failure".This is a simple
      approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if
      you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and
      you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might be able to number the
      <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order.Then,if you
      have just tried <b>child k,</b> you know that you hsve already tried
      children 1 through <b>k-1</b> and you have not yet tried children
      <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> or,if you are trying to colour a map with
      with just four colors, you can always try<b
        >red first, then yellow,then green,then blue.</b
      >If child yellow fails, you know know to try child green next.If you are
      searching a maze, you can try choicees in the order left, straight,
      right,right<b>(or perhaps north,east,south,west).</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a
      node.<b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your pieces (or
      perhaps the square of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in
      additionaleach pieced may also have several moves, and these must also be
      ordered.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Example: Tree Search</h2>
    <p>
      For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking,
      which is searching an actual tree. we will also use the simplest kind of
      tree, a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is desinated
      as the root node. Each node can reference (point to ) zero, one, or two
      other nodes, which are called its childfren. The children are reffered to
      as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are rechable (by one
      or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our
      purposes, although this is not part of the definition of binary tree, we
      will say that a dnode might or might not be a goal node, and will contain
      its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a
      binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>Here's defination of the Binary Tree class:</p>
    <pre>
      public class Binary tree{
        BinaryTree leftchild = null;
        Binarytree rightchild = null;
        boolean is GoalNodd = false;
        string name; 

      BinaryTree{String name, BinaryTreeleft, BinaryTree right, boolean is GoalNode} {
       this.name = name;
       leftchild = left;
       rightChild - right;
       this.is GoalNode = isGoalNode;  
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method
      makeTree() which construct the above binary tree.
    </p>
    <pre>
      static Binary Tree makeTree(){
        Binary Tree root, a,b,c,d,e,f;
        c = new BinaryTree ("C",null,null,false);
        d = new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
        e = new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
        f = new BinaryTree("F",null,null,false);
        a = new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
        b = new BinaryTree("B",e,f,false);
        root = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
        return root;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it;</p>
    <pre>
      public static void main{String args[]} {
        BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
        System.out.println(solvable(tree));
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the
      binary tree by finding a goal node.
    </p>
    <pre>
      statics boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
       /*1*/ if (node == null)return false;
       /*2*/ if (node.is GoalNode) return true;
       /*3*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
       /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightchild)) return true;
       /*5*/ return false;

      }
    </pre>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        if we are given a null node, it's not solvable.This statement is so that
        we can call this method with the children of a node, without first
        checking whether those children actually exist.
      </li>
      <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
      <li>
        see if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node
        is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null and is
        not a goal node, says to
      </li>
      <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
      <li>
        Since neither child of node is solvable, node itselff is not solvable.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null.In the
      above we put that check as the first thing in solvable.An alternative
      would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they
      do.Here's that alternative version:
    </p>
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree,node) {
          if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
          if(node.leftchild!=null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
          return false;
        }
      </pre
    >
    <p>
      I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly
      more efficient.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the children?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the simplifies the above binary is that,at each choice point, you
      can ignore all the previous choices.Previous choices don't give you any
      information about what you should do next; as far as you know both the
      left and the right are possible solutions.In many problems, however, you
      may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem
      of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the
      countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two
      countries that share a border are the same colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      To color a map, you choose a color for the first country; then a color for
      the second country; and so on, until all countries are colored.
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li type="disc">
        Method 1.Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run
        out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.
      </li>
      <li type="disc">
        Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an
        adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of coutries, you
        have successfully colored the map.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a
      checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;after all, a checkerboard
      only needs two colors.
    </p>
    <h4>boolean maplsOK()</h4>
    <p>
      Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is
      colored correctly.
    </p>
    <h4>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h4>
    <p>
      Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent
      node already colored with the given color.
    </p>
    <h4>int[] nextRowAndColumn(iny row, int column)</h4>
    <p>
      Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and
      column of the next square on the checkerboard).
    </p>
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <pre>
      boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color){
        if (row >= Num_ Rows)return maplsOK();
        map[row][column] = color;
        for(int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++){
          int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column)
          if(exploree1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
        }
        return false;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>And here's the code for method 2;</p>
    <pre>
      boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color){
        if(row>= NUM_ROWS)return true;
        if(okToColor(row, column, color)){
          map[row][column] = color;
          for(int nextColor = RED;nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++){
            int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
            if(explore2(next[0],next[1],nextColor))return true;
          }
        }
        return false;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Those appear preety similar, and you might think they are equally good .
      However, the timing information suggest otherwise:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>2 by 3 map</th>
        <th>3 by 3 map</th>
        <th>3 by 4 map</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Method 1:</th>
        <td>60 ms.</td>
        <td>940 ms.</td>
        <td>60530 ms.(1 minute)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Method 2:</th>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
        <td>0 ms.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The zeros in the above table indicates times too short to measures (less
      than 1 millisecond ).Why this huge difference? Either of these methods
      could have exponential growth.Elimaniting a node automatically eliminates
      all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth.
      Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential
      growth is practically guaranteed. If there isany way to eliminate children
      (reduce the set of choices),do so!
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it_
      Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting
      print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
      print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are
      especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
    </p>
    <h3>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h3>
    <p>
      Often, the best debugging technique IS to print every method call and
      return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to printr
      for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves
      with. However, if you just print a long list ot these, it's hard to match
      up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the
      level of nesting can help.
    </p>
    <h3>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h3>
    <p>
      Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that
      code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the
      worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more
      debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs
    </p>
    <pre>
      static String indent = "";
      
      static String name(BinaryTree node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        else return node.name;
      } 
      
      static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
        System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) +
        indent = indent + "| ";
      }

      static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
        indent - indent-substring(3);
        System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
        return true;
      }

      static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
        indent = indent.substring(3);
        System.out.println(indent + "solvable(i' + name(node) + 'i) returns false");
        return false;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <pre>
      static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
        enter(node);
        if (node null) return no(node);
        if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
        if (solvable(node.IeftChiId)) return yes(node);
        if (solvable(node.rightChiId)) return yes(node);
        return no(node);

      }
    </pre>
    <p>And we get these results:</p>
    <pre>
      Entering solvable(Root)
      | Entering solvable(A)
      | | Entering solvable(C)
      | | | Entering solvable(null)
      | | | solvable(null) returns false
      | | | Entering solvable(null)
      | | | solvable(null) returns false
      | | Entering solvable(D)
      | | | Entering solvable(null)
      | | | solvable(null) returns false
      | | | Entering solvable(null)
      | | | solvable(null) returns false
      | solvable(A) returns false
      | Entering solvable(B)
      | | Entering solvable(E)
      | | solvable(E) returns true
      | solvable(B) returns true
      solvable(Root) reurns true
      true 
    </pre>
    <h3>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
    <p>
      Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work
      to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program,
      Once your program is working. why throw this code away?
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from
      a program you are ready to submit (or to turn aver to your manager). You
      could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work.
      What's more, in the above exampler you would have to replace every with
      return(true), and every with return false. With all these changes, you
      might introduce new bugs into your program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For
      example,
    </p>
    <pre>
      static final boolean debugging = false;

      static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
          System.out.println(indent  + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
          indent = indent + "| ";
        }
      }

      static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
        indent = indent.substring(3);
        System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" name(node) + returns true");
        }
        return true;
      }

      static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
          indent - indent.substring(3);
          System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
        }
        return false;

      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control
      different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your
      code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable
      debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will bc
      discarded,
    </p>

    <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>

    <p>
      If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it
      happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an
      Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own
      Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can
      create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code
    </p>
    <pre>new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
    <p>
      will print out a message something like this. and the program will then
      continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print
      statement.
    </p>

    <pre>
      java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie
        at TreeSearchsolvable(TreeSearch.java:S3)
        at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:57)
        at TreeSearch.main(TreeSearch.java:72)

    <h2>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h2>

    <p>
      I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You
      have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white marbles,
      and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1
      spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end
      (say, the left}, the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space
      in between.
    </p>

    <table border="1" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./black-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./black-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>

    <table border="1" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./black-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
        <td width="50px"><img src="./black-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can
      only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a marble can either:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>
        Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space
        just beyond that marble is clear.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:</p>

    <table align="center">
      <tr>
        <th>Starting position :</th>
        <td>
          <table border="1" align="center">

              <td width="30px"><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="" /></td>
            </tr>

      he backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In
      solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, hich in this
      case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't
      so easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a
      recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The
      backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or
      it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      ac possi e move WI resu t In a new oar position, an t ese new oar
      positions aret ec I reno t e current oar position. Hence to find the
      children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the
      possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable
      to find an ordering on these possible moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      ere it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze
      the game to some extent. Probably a number of pproaches would work, and
      what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program
      this puzzle, you might find different but equally valid approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can
      move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move
      ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might
      assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have
      looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This
      would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or
      else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board
      each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very
      attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check,
      in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one
      moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method
      canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is
      possible from the given position:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
      <li>
        If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or
        jump to the right;
      </li>
      <li>
        If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or
        jump to the left.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We write another method
      <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board
      and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a
      new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the
      old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned
      with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather
      than "mutative."
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with<b> canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods
      <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that should be obvious.
    </p>
    <pre>
      boolean solvable(int[] board) {
        if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
          return true;
        }
        for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
          if (canMove(board, position)) {
            int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);
            if (solvable(newBoard)) {
              printBoard(newBoard);
              return true;

            }
          }
        }
        return false;

      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and
      printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.
    </p>
    <p>Here is some output from the program:</p>
    <pre>
      <i> <font color="blue">16.</font> <b>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">15.</font> <b>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">14.</font> <b>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">13.</font> <b>WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">12.</font> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">11.</font> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">10.</font> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">9. </font> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">8. </font> <b>WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">7. </font> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">6. </font> <b>BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">5. </font> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">4. </font> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">3. </font> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">2. </font> <b>BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE </b></i>
      <i> <font color="blue">1. </font> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE </b></i>
  </pre>
  <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last
    line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its
    results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get
    them in the correct order.
